## Hi Community

Alfredo CÃ¡ceres speaking. A few years ago, when I was working in Azerbaijan as Chemical Engineer my mentality changed, uncovering a strong feeling to tackle some of the main challenges we are facing as a society.
One of the ideas I thought could have the highest impact would be working on social and sustainable data science projects, but first I had to develop my data science skills by acquiring a solid knowledge of the main technologies and algorithms, to be capable of connecting all the dots to create something revolutionary.

Since then, I have completed a dual degree with an IMBA and a Master's in Business Analytics and Big Data at IE University in Madrid which helped me a lot in developing all the skills needed for my initial purpose. Now I'm involved in some projects highly focused into improve the sustainability impact on industrial bioprocesses using a MultiObjective Optimization approach, something that I cannot initially share here, but if you are interested, just send me an email and we can discuss it.

During the Master I've developed some projects - across data visualization, EDA, ML and big data technologies, NLP, and SNA.
With every project I've tried to think out of the box and to reach the excellence, without forgetting to tackle any social or sustainability inequalities presented.

My goal with this GitHub repo is to showcase the projects I work on in an easy-to-consume way. Feel free to explore. 
If you see anything that get your attention or would like to collaborate on a project together, please don't hesitate to reach out!
