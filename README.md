## Hi Community

Alfredo CÃ¡ceres speaking. A few years ago, when I was working in Azerbaijan as Chemical Engineer my mentality changed, which uncovered a strong feeling for helping others.
One of the ideas I thought could have the highest impact would be working on social and sustainable data science projects, but first I had to develop my data science skills to be able to connect all the dots to create something revolutionary.
Since then, I have completed a dual degree with an IMBA and a Master in Business Analytics and Big Data at IE University in Madrid which helped me a lot developing
all the skills needed for my initial purpose.

During this time I've developed some projects - across data visualization, EDA, ML and big data technologies, NLP, and SNA.
With every project I've tried to think out of the box and to reach the excellence, without forgetting to tackle any social or sustainability inequalities presented.

My goal with this github repo is to showcase the projects I work on in an easy to consume way. Feel free to explore. 
If you see anything that piques your interest or would like to collaborate on a project together, please don't hesitate to reach out!
